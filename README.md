# Paws UI Kit

The official Vue 3 component library for the Paws application.

This project uses **Storybook** as the primary development environment for building and testing components in isolation.

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shsh-x/Paws-UI-Kit.git
    cd Paws-UI-Kit
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Storybook server:**
    ```bash
    npm run storybook
    ```

This will launch the Storybook interface in your browser. All component development happens here.

## Contributing

To add a new component:

1.  Create your `.vue` component file in `src/components/`.
2.  Create a corresponding `.stories.js` file for it in `src/stories/` to make it appear in Storybook.
